    <h1>Literally Who?</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>I'm Alex. I make games usually. I've done my fair share of other projects unrelated to gamedev, like composing, drawing and 3D modelling.<br>
    My bread and butter however is definitely making games. I'm pretty good at it. I've been studying the subject for my entire concious life, so I'd like to think I know a thing or two.</p>

    <p>Screenshot of my most recent game. Despite it's slightly wacky look, it's a real game that took me a few weeks to make, entirely in a really old Japanese Engine called suika2<br>(Unrelated,
    but that engine in question recently got opened up and had its source code uploaded to a github repo.)<br>Another neat thing, is that the font this site is written in, is my favorite font of all time<br>
    Entirely otf (Open type face), and also supports cyrllic writing, което го прави много лесен за работа дори и с български освен, че е приятен за гледане</p>
